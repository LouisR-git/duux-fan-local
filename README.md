# üåÄ Duux Fan - Local integration for Home Assistant

**Take back control of your Duux fan - locally, privately, and cloud-free.**

This project allows you to use your **Duux Whisper Flex smart fan** entirely outside of Duux‚Äôs cloud ecosystem by redirecting its MQTT communication to a **local broker**, giving you **full local control** via **Home Assistant**.

No cloud. No account. No lag.

## üìå Supported models

This integration has been tested and validated on the following models:

- **Duux Whisper Flex**
- **Duux Whisper Flex 2**

The integration automatically adapts to your fan's capabilities based on the selected generation. It supports power, speed, modes, and horizontal/vertical oscillation... See the `Supported Features/Models` section below for details.

Other models may work but are not officially supported.
Please contribute your feedback to help improve compatibility.

## üß© Installation via HACS

This integration is not (yet) available in the official HACS default repository list.
However, you can easily add it as a **custom repository**:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.][myha-repo-badge]][myha-repo]

1. Open **HACS** in your Home Assistant interface
2. Click the **three dots (‚ãÆ)** in the top-right corner and select **"Custom repositories"**
3. Paste the following URL:
   `https://github.com/LouisR-git/duux-fan-local`
4. Select **"Integration"** as the category
5. Click **Add**, then search for `Duux Fan Local` in HACS and install it
6. Restart Home Assistant to finalize the setup

The integration will now appear like any standard Home Assistant integration.

### Initial setup

1. Follow the **instructions below** to install the required prerequisites:
   - ‚úÖ **DNS redirection** (reroute Duux API calls to your local Broker)
   - ‚úÖ **MQTT Broker** (Mosquitto, EMQX, ...)

2. In Home Assistant, go to `Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration` and search for `Duux Fan Local`.
3. Select your fan model from the list.
4. Give your device a friendly name.
5. Enter the **MAC address** of your Duux fan
   > üí° You can find it in your router‚Äôs connected devices list.
6. Click **Submit** and enjoy local control of your fan!

## üß∞ Prerequisites

Duux fans communicate with the cloud using **MQTT over TLS**.
By spoofing the cloud hostname and running your own MQTT broker, you can intercept this traffic and integrate the fan directly into Home Assistant.

You‚Äôll need:

- **Control over your local DNS resolution** (AdGuard, CoreDNS, dnsmasq‚Ä¶)
- **A self-hosted MQTT broker**, reachable as `collector3.cloudgarden.nl` on port 443
- Basic Linux CLI knowledge

## üåê Local DNS spoofing

From your local DNS server, redirect the Duux cloud MQTT hostname to your local MQTT server‚Äôs IP.
```
collector3.cloudgarden.nl ‚Üí 192.168.x.x
```

### Example: AdGuard DNS rewrite

Go to AdGuard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí DNS Rewrites

### Example: Ubiquiti Unifi Gateway

Go to Console ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Policy Engine ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Create a new `Host (A)` entry

### Reboot the fan after DNS changes
Unplug ‚Üí remove the battery ‚Üí wait ~1 second ‚Üí reinsert ‚Üí power on.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up a local MQTT broker

### Option A - EMQX (TLS + Authentication) - **Recommended**
- **Goal:** A robust local setup with TLS encryption and username/password authentication.  
- üìñ See the [EMQX installation guide](docs/guide-emqx.md)

### Option B - Mosquitto (Anonymous TLS)
- **Goal:** The quickest option for labs or testing environments.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security:** Not secure (anonymous access).  
- üìñ See the [Mosquitto installation guide](docs/guide-mosquitto.md)

| Feature             |   Key    | Command Payload     | Value X=                               |
|---------------------|----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Power**           | `power`  | `tune set power X`  | `0`: off, `1`: on                      |
| **Mode**            | `mode`   | `tune set mode X`   | `0`: fan mode, `1`: natural wind       |

| **Charging Status** | `batcha` | N/A                 | `0`: not charging , `1`: charging      |

### Known Issues

- **Charging Status** does not update automatically when the battery is fully charged.
  The fan only refreshes this attribute when the Power state changes.
   This is a **firmware limitation**.


## üì° Details

The fan uses MQTT topics to report its state and receive commands.

### MQTT Broker Endpoint
```
mqtts://collector3.cloudgarden.nl:443
```

### Fan publishes to:

| Topic                         | Example Payload                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sensor/{device_id}/in`       | `{"sub":{"Tune":[{"uid":"xyz","power":1,"mode":0,"speed":10,"timer": 0,"horosc": 0,"verosc": 0,"lock": 0,"night": 1,"batcha": 0,"batlvl": 10}]}}` |
| `sensor/{device_id}/online`   | `{"online":true,"connectionType":"mqtt"}`                                       |
| `sensor/{device_id}/update`   | `{"pid":"xyz","tune":"DUUX Whisper Flex 2"}`                                    |

> The fan publishes data immediately when a change occurs, and otherwise every 30 seconds to keep the online status active.


### Fan subscribes to:

| Topic                          | Example Payload             |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `sensor/{device_id}/command`   | `tune set speed 10`         |
| `sensor/{device_id}/config`    | _(Unused)_                  |
| `sensor/{device_id}/fw`        | _(Unused)_                  |


## ‚úÖ Result

Your Duux fan is now fully **cloud-free** and controllable through **your local network** and **Home Assistant**.
Enjoy full privacy, instant response times, and true independence from proprietary services.

> **Note:** When connected to your local MQTT, the fan will no longer be able to receive firmware updates from the manufacturer.
> Disable local DNS forwarding and restart your fan to access the web again.

## üõë Disclaimer

This setup **spoofs a cloud domain** and runs services on privileged ports. Use only in **lab environments** or **isolated networks**.
For educational and interoperability purposes only.


## üôå Credits

Based on reverse engineering, packet sniffing, vibe coding ~~and a lot of fan noise~~.
A special thanks to the Home Assistant community for their valuable insights and contributions, especially the discussion in [this topic][ha-forum-duux-topic] which greatly helped this integration.
Contributions welcome! üõ†Ô∏è
