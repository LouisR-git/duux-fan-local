# üåÄ Duux Fan ‚Äì Local Integration for Home Assistant

**Take back control of your Duux fan - locally, privately, and cloud-free.**

This project allows you to use your **Duux Whisper Flex smart fan** entirely outside of Duux‚Äôs cloud ecosystem by redirecting its MQTT communication to a **local broker** , giving you full local control via **Home Assistant**.

No cloud. No account. No lag.

## üìå Supported Models

This integration has been tested and validated on the following models:

- **DUUX Whisper Flex 1** (v1 generation)
- **DUUX Whisper Flex 2** (v2 generation)

### Model Differences

The integration automatically adapts to your fan's capabilities based on the generation you select:

**Whisper Flex 1 (v1):**
- Speed range: 0-26
- Mode options: Normal, Natural, Night
- Horizontal oscillation: On/Off
- Vertical oscillation: On/Off

**Whisper Flex 2 (v2):**
- Speed range: 0-30
- Mode options: Fan, Natural
- Horizontal oscillation: Off, 30¬∞, 60¬∞, 90¬∞
- Vertical oscillation: Off, 45¬∞, 100¬∞
- Child Lock
- Night Mode: On/Off

Other models may work but are not officially supported.
Please contribute your feedback to help improve compatibility.

## üß© Installation via HACS

This integration is not (yet) available in the official HACS default repository list.
However, you can easily add it as a **custom repository**:

1. Open **HACS** in your Home Assistant interface
2. Click the **three dots (‚ãÆ)** in the top-right corner and select **"Custom repositories"**
3. Paste the following URL:
   `https://github.com/LouisR-git/duux-fan-local`
4. Select **"Integration"** as the category
5. Click **Add**, then search for `Duux Fan Local` in HACS and install it
6. Restart Home Assistant to finalize the setup

The integration will now appear like any standard Home Assistant integration.

### Initial setup

1. Follow the instructions below to install the required prerequisites:
   - ‚úÖ **MQTT Broker** (e.g., Mosquitto)
   - ‚úÖ **DNS redirection** (reroute Duux API calls to your local Broker)
2. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration** and search for **Duux Fan Local**.
3. Select your fan model from the list.
4. Give your device a friendly name.
5. Enter the **MAC address** of your Duux fan
   > üí° You can find it in your router‚Äôs connected devices list.
6. Click **Submit** and enjoy local control of your fan!

## üß∞ Prerequisites

Duux fans communicate with the cloud using **MQTT over TLS**.
By **spoofing the cloud hostname** and running your own MQTT broker, you can intercept this traffic and integrate the fan directly into **Home Assistant**.

You‚Äôll need:

- **Control over your local DNS resolution** (AdGuard, CoreDNS, dnsmasq‚Ä¶)
- **A self-hosted MQTT broker**, reachable as `collector3.cloudgarden.nl` on port 443
- Basic Linux CLI knowledge


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Local MQTT Broker

Any Linux host will work. Below is an example using a **Proxmox LXC container**.

üí° Other solutions exist, such as setting up **port forwarding (DNAT)** to an existing MQTT broker...

### LXC Mosquitto Setup (Port 443 + TLS)

#### 1. Create the container

You can use this helper script (optional but easy):
üëâ https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=mqtt

> ‚úÖ No need for a privileged container.

#### 2. Mosquitto TLS Configuration

Edit `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`:

```ini
user root  # Required to bind to port 443
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Running as root is not recommended. Use it only in isolated environments.

Then remove the default config:

```bash
rm /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf
```

Create a custom config at `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/duux-fan.conf`:

```ini
listener 443
allow_anonymous true

# TLS settings
certfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/mosquitto.crt
keyfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/mosquitto.key
require_certificate false
tls_version tlsv1.2
```

#### 3. Create Self-Signed Certificates

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/mosquitto/certs/
cd /etc/mosquitto/certs/

openssl genrsa -out mosquitto.key 2048
openssl req -new -key mosquitto.key -out collector3.cloudgarden.csr
```

üìå When prompted, set the **Common Name** (CN) to:
```
collector3.cloudgarden.nl
```

Then sign it:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in collector3.cloudgarden.csr -signkey mosquitto.key -out mosquitto.crt -days 3650
```

#### 4. Restart the broker

```bash
service mosquitto restart
```

## üåê Local DNS Spoofing

Redirect the Duux cloud MQTT hostname to your local MQTT server‚Äôs IP.

### Example: AdGuard DNS Rewrite

Go to AdGuard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí DNS Rewrites:

```
collector3.cloudgarden.nl ‚Üí 192.168.x.x  # Your Mosquitto IP
```

Other options: `dnsmasq`, `CoreDNS`, `Unbound`‚Ä¶

## üîÑ Reboot the Fan

To apply DNS changes :

- Unplug the fan
- Remove the battery
- Wait 2 seconds
- Replug

It should now connect to your **local MQTT broker on port 443** using TLS.

## üì° Explanations

The fan uses MQTT topics to report its state and receive commands.

### MQTT Broker Endpoint
```
mqtts://collector3.cloudgarden.nl:443
```

### Fan publishes to:

Enjoy full privacy, instant response times, and true independence from proprietary services.


## üõë Disclaimer

This setup **spoofs a cloud domain** and runs services on privileged ports. Use only in **lab environments** or **isolated networks**.
For educational and interoperability purposes only.
